					<h2>Coding Projects</h2>
                    <h3>Data Structures</h3>
                    <p>
                        Recreated several different data structures such as vector, binary tree, stack, and list with full functionality, in C++, showing strong knowledge and expertise in the field of computer science. Each data structure can be used with all of the same functions that can be found in the standard library. Developing these projects helped me increase my understanding and effectiveness when it comes to coding as I had to build these data structures from scratch while paying attention to time complexity and space complexity.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Chess Game</h3>
                    <p>
                        Designed a chess game with graphics in Java that allows two human players to play through an entire game of chess. This project features a user-friendly menu that allows to start and exit the game, and a custom chess board with pieces that can be dragged and dropped. This project exemplifies a deep understanding of different Java libraries and graphics.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Text Editor</h3>
